## Myntra Web Clone

This is a simple Myntra homepage clone that I built using only HTML and CSS.
The goal of this project was to practice front-end basics and improve my understanding of layouts and styling without using any frameworks or JavaScript.

## Features

Built with just HTML & CSS (no external libraries or JS)

Homepage layout similar to Myntra

Basic responsiveness for different screen sizes



## Purpose

This project was created purely for learning and practice.

It helped me strengthen my front-end skills by focusing only on HTML and CSS.

## Disclaimer
